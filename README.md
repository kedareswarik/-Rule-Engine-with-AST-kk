# Rule Engine

## Overview

The Rule Engine is a Java-based application designed to evaluate complex rules against user data. It takes rules defined as strings, converts them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), combines multiple rules efficiently, and evaluates them based on provided user attributes.

## Features

- **Rule Creation**: Convert rule strings into AST representations.
- **Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules into a single AST using efficient strategies.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate combined rules against user data to determine eligibility based on defined criteria.
